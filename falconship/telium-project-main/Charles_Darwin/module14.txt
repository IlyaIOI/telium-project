The Crew Quarters
The crew have their own place where they sleep and relax. Here in the Crew Quarters they thought of themselves as more important even if they were equals to us. I used to hate them but now that they are dead, I feel really bad. On Earth they were nobody's but here that were able to be a sombody and just wanted someone to see them as people not just junk.
